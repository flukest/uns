# Unified Naming Standard
known as the UNS, is a continuation of the UNC because let's be real - UNC is slowly but surely going to become deprecated since it isn't maintained.

This is a open-source project where everyone's opinion counts. We aren't changing anything drastically, but instead continuing UNC.

## Why?
We want to continue support for UNC, and allow scripters and exploit developers to easily follow a regular standard.

It's going to be hard using an outdated standard, or an executor where you don't know what functions it supports, or how those functions work.

## How?
The UNS provides standards for naming conventions as well as API functionality. The standard is written in markdown on this GitHub. Edits or additions are done through pull requests.

## Help us!
You can submit an issue or pull request to talk about what should be changed or added.

**Start now** by creating a issue [here](https://github.com/flukest/uns/issues)!

### For exploit developers!
Check now what functions your executor supports. Supporting UNS doesn't mean to get all functions, but rather the functions you support.

Let your users know that you support UNS so they can access the documenation easily.

### For script developers!
See if your script is using the UNS functions properly. If the executor you are using supports UNS, you can use the environment checking script to see what functions you can use.
